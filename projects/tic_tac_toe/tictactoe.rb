# How will you keep track of whose turn it is?
# What data structure will you use to keep track of the board? You only
#   know two (Array, Hash), but remember they can be nested (meaning an
#   array can contain another arrayâ€”it can even contain a hash that contains
#   another hash, though unclear if that will be useful :P)
# When a player makes a move, what should happen?
# How do you keep track of which squares have Xs and which have Os?
# How do you detect a winner?
# When does the program stop? Is there a loop? If so, what kind?
