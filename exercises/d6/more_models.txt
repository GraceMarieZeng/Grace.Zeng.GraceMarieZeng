What data do we want to store? List all the information we could ever want to store (for example, "items that are in a user's shopping cart"). Come with at least 10.
What actions can be done? Try to think in terms of who or what does what action to what data ("A user creates a tweet"). Also think CRUD!
Can you group your data into models (i.e. Tweet or User)? What are those models? A great starting place to think up of models are the actors or actees of your actions (in the above example a user and a tweet). Note that there are often no "right" answers to these questions—it's up to you, the designer, to determine how your app works. What are the attributes (name, handle, body, price, etc.) of each model? How do you decide what's an attribute and what's another model entirely?
What are the relationships between the models? Note which ones "belong to" others, "have many" others, or "have and belong to many" others. Draw a model diagram like we did in class.
Finally, draw the tables for each model, including all of its attributes. Include any join tables you have as well.
